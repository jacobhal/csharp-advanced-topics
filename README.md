## Generics
Generics were added to C# quite early in order to make it possible to reuse the same classes in multiple places. For instance, instead of having to create a class called BookList, CarList etc. for every specific type of list that we want, we can now use a generic type of list.

Below are some example usages of creating generics. The consumer of the methods/classes specifies what type T should be. We also have a couple of constraints, for instance we have two for GenericList: `where T: class, new()`. These constraints specify that the consumer type T must be a class and that it must have a parameterless constructor.

```cs
// Generic List
public class GenericList<T> : where T: class, new() {
    public void Add(T value) {
        T tmp = new T(); // Would not be able to do this if we do not have the new() constraint
    }

    public T this[int index] {
        get { throw new NotImplementedException(); }
    }
}

// Generic dictionary
public class GenericDictionary<K, V> {
    public void Add(K key, V value) {

    }
}

// Generic Max method
public T Max<T>(T a, T b) where T : IComparable {
    return a.CompareTo(b) > 0 ? a : b; // Would not have access to CompareTo method without the IComparable constraint
}

// Generic Nullable (A struct similar to this is already part of System.Nullable)
public class Nullable<T> where T : struct {
    private object _value;

    public Nullable(){}

    public Nullable(T value) {
        _value = value;
    }

    public bool HasValue {
        get { return _value != null; }
    }

    public T GetValueOrDefault() {
        if (HasValue) return (T) _value;

        return default(T); // Return the default value of the value type (0 for int etc.)
    }
}
```

> In most cases you will be using Generics and not create your own.

In .NET, the generic predefined classes are located in *System.Collections.Generic.\**.

### Different type of constraints
* `where T : IComparable` - Constraint T to an interface
* `where T : Product` - The consumer must be a Product or any class that derives from Product (a subclass of Product)
* `where T : struct` - T must be a value type (directly store the value in memory like int)
* `where T : class` - T must be a class
* `where T : new()` - T must have a default constructor

### IEnumerable vs ICollection vs IList
These three generics are very common. The difference between them is the following:  

#### IEnumerable
An IEnumerable is a list or a container which can hold some items. You can iterate through each element in the IEnumerable. You can not edit the items like adding, deleting, updating, etc. instead you just use a container to contain a list of items. It is the most basic type of list container.  

All you get in an IEnumerable is an enumerator that helps in iterating over the elements. An IEnumerable does not hold even the count of the items in the list, instead, you have to iterate over the elements to get the count of items.
An IEnumerable supports filtering elements using where clause.

#### ICollection
ICollection is another type of collection, which derives from IEnumerable and extends itâ€™s functionality to add, remove, update element in the list. ICollection also holds the count of elements in it and we does not need to iterate over all elements to get total number of elements.

#### IList
IList extends ICollection. An IList can perform all operations combined from IEnumerable and ICollection, and some more operations like inserting or removing an element in the middle of a list.

## Delegates
Delegate definition:
* An object that knows how to call a method (or a group of methods)
* A reference to a function

Delegates makes it possible to design extensible and flexible applications (e.g. frameworks). If we look at the code example below, we create a program for processing photos and adding different filters to the processing. Instead of having a set of filters that are always applied (the code that is commented out), we can use delegates and instead make the user apply the filters that they want when processing a photo. This also allow the users to create and apply their own filters aslong as it meets the delegate's function signature.

> Delegates are very similar to using the Decorator pattern!

```cs
namespace Delegates {
    class Photo {
        public static Photo Load(string path) {
            return new Photo();
        }

        public void Save() {}
    }

    class PhotoFilters {
        public void ApplyBrightness(Photo photo) { Console.WriteLine("Apply brightness") }
        public void ApplyContrast(Photo photo) { Console.WriteLine("Apply contrast") }
        public void Resize(Photo photo) { Console.WriteLine("Resize photo") }
    }

    class PhotoProcessor {
        public delegate void PhotoFilterHandler(Photo photo);
        
        public void Process(string path, PhotoFilterHandler filterHandler) {
            var photo = Photo.Load(path);

            filterHandler(photo);

            // BEFORE USING DELEGATES
            // var filters = new PhotoFilters();
            // filters.ApplyBrightness(photo);
            // filters.ApplyContrast(photo);
            // filters.Resize(photo);

            photo.Save();
        }
    }

    class Program {
        static void Main(string[] args) {
            var processor = new PhotoProcessor();
            var filters = new PhotoFilters();
            PhotoProcessor.PhotoFilterHandler filterHandler = filters.ApplyBrightness;
            filterHandler += filters.ApplyContrast;
            filterHandler += RemoveRedEyeFilter;

            processor.Process("photo.jpg", filterHandler);
        }

        static void RemoveRedEyeFilter(Photo photo) { Console.WriteLine("Apply RemoveRedEye") }
    }
}
```

### Action, Func and Predicate
Action, Func and Predicate are two predefined delegates that are shipped with the .NET framework.

#### Action
Action points to a method that accepts one or more arguments and returns void.

The code example below prints "Hello!!!" to the console using the Action delegate.

```cs
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Action<string> action = new Action<string>(Display);
    action("Hello!!!");
    Console.Read();
}

static void Display(string message)
{
    Console.WriteLine(message);
}
```

Below is the photo processing example using Actions instead:

```cs
class PhotoProcessor {
    public delegate void PhotoFilterHandler(Photo photo);
    
    public void Process(string path, Action<Photo> filterHandler) {
        var photo = Photo.Load(path);

        filterHandler(photo);

        photo.Save();
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var processor = new PhotoProcessor();
        var filters = new PhotoFilters();
        Action<Photo> filterHandler = filters.ApplyBrightness;
        filterHandler += filters.ApplyContrast;
        filterHandler += RemoveRedEyeFilter;

        processor.Process("photo.jpg", filterHandler);
    }

    static void RemoveRedEyeFilter(Photo photo) { Console.WriteLine("Apply RemoveRedEye") }
}
```

#### Func
Func points to a method that accepts one or more arguments and returns a value.

The following code snippet illustrates how you can use a Func delegate in C#. It prints the value of Hra (calculated as 40% of basic salary). The basic salary is passed to it as an argument.

```cs
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Func<int, double> func = new Func<int, double>(CalculateHra);
    Console.WriteLine(func(50000));
    Console.Read();
}

static double CalculateHra(int basic)
{
    return (double)(basic * .4);
}
```

> Note that the second parameter in the declaration of the Func delegate in the code snippet represents the return type of the method to which the delegate would point. In this example, the calculated Hra value is returned as double.


#### Predicate
A Predicate delegate is typically used to search items in a collection or a set of data.

The code example below creates a Predicate delegate filter that is used to filter out the persons with Id = 1. The output in this case would be "Jacob".

```cs
class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<Customer> custList = new List<Customer>();
        custList.Add(new Customer { Id = 1, FirstName = "Jacob", LastName = "Hallman" });
        custList.Add(new Customer { Id = 2, FirstName = "Elon", LastName = "Musk" });
        Predicate<Customer> firstCustomer = x => x.Id == 1;
        Customer customer = custList.Find(firstCustomer);
        Console.WriteLine(customer.FirstName);
        Console.Read(); 
    }
}
```

> Note that Predicate<T> is basically equivalent to Func<T,bool>.

### Interfaces vs Delegates
An alternative to delegates is using interfaces, how do we decide which to use?

**Use a delegate when**
* An eventing design pattern is used.
* The caller doesn't need to access other properties or methods on the object implementing the method.
* The interface defines only a single method.
* Multicast capability is needed (combining filters for instance).
* The subscriber needs to implement the interface multiple times.

Below are two code examples, one using interfaces and one using delegates:

```cs
interface IMyInterface    
{    
    int MySum(int a, int b);    
}    
  
public class MyClassTest : IMyInterface    
{    
    public int MySum(int a, int b)    
    {    
        return a + b;    
    }    
}    
```

```cs
public delegate int MyDelegate(int a, int b);    
public class MyClass    
{    
    public static int Addition(int a, int b)    
    {    
        return a + b;    
    }    
}    
```

Comparing usage:

```cs
static void Main() 
{
    // Interface:
    IMyInterface myClassTest = new MyClassTest();    
    Console.WriteLine(myClassTest.MySum(10, 20));    
    
    // Delegates:
    MyDelegate myDelegate = MyClass.Addition;    
    Console.WriteLine(myDelegate(10, 20));    
}
```

So, Delegate made it smaller. But, it can be written in more optimized and smaller way like the following: 

```cs
static void Main(string[] args)    
{    
    Func<int, int, int> operation = (a, b) => a + b;    
    Console.WriteLine(operation(10, 20));    
    Console.ReadKey();    
}   
```

There are so many differences between Delegate and Event. But, I will explain one practical difference between them.

The main difference is that different delegate instances can be provided for the same delegate from the same class. But, it did not happen with Interface.

We can see this by looking at the following example comparison:

```cs
public delegate int MyDelegate(int a, int b);    
public class MyClassResult    
{    
    // Below All methods can be used to implement the MyDelegate Delegate.    
    void M1(int MyDelegate) { }    
    void M2(int MyDelegate) { }    
    void M3(int MyDelegate) { }    
    void M4(int MyDelegate) { }    
}   
```

```cs
interface IMyInterfaceExample    
{    
    void MyResult(int a, int b);    
}    
   
public class MyClassExample : IMyInterfaceExample    
{    
    public void MyResult(int a, int b)    
    {    
        // Only this method can be used to call an implementation through an interface    
    }    
}  
```


## Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions or anonymous functions are used in almost every programming language these days.  
Essentially, a lambda expression can be defined like this:  

An anonymous method that:  
* Has no access modifier (public, private etc.)
* Has no name
* Has no return statement

Lambda functions are used for convenience and readability. Below is a comparison between a normal function and a lambda function:  

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    int number = 5;

    // Lambda functions using delegates (format: args => expression)
    // No argument lambda function: () => ...
    // One argument lambda function: x => ...
    // Multiple argument lambda function: (x, y) => ...
    Func<int, int> square = n => number*number;
    Console.WriteLine(square(number));

    // Normal function
    number = 5;
    Console.WriteLine(Square(number));
}

static int Square(int number) {
    return number*number;
}
```

Below is a lambda expression code example for filtering books. This kind of filtering by using a Predicate delegate as argument is extremely common:    

```cs
class Book {
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int Price { get; set; }
}

class BookRepository {
    public List<Book> GetBooks() {
        return new List<Book> {
            new Book() {Title = "Title 1", Price = 5},
            new Book() {Title = "Title 2", Price = 7},
            new Book() {Title = "Title 3", Price = 17}
        };
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var books = new BookRepository().GetBooks();

        var cheapBooks = books.FindAll(b => b.Price < 10);

        foreach(var book in cheapBooks) {
            Console.WriteLine(book);
        }
    }
}
```

## Events
A definition of events:  
* A mechanism for communication between objects. This means that when something happens inside an object it can notify other objects about it.
* Used in building *Loosely Coupled Applications*. This means that the classes or components are not tightly coupled together. A loosely coupled application is easy to extend without breaking or changing one or more of its existing capabilities.
* Helps extending applications.

If we look at the code example below, we add an extra line in order to also allow the Encode method to send a text message after encoding is complete. However, this means that VideoEncoder and all classes that depend on it have to be recompliled which is a bad thing. Events can help is solve this problem.

```cs
public class VideoEncoder {
    public void Encode(Video video) {
        // Encoding logic...

        _mailService.Send(new Mail());

        // If we add the following line to also send a text message after encoding, the whole class/method and all classes that depend on the VideoEncoder have to be recompiled.
        _messageService.Send(new Text());
    }
}
```

Events are basically a way to implement the Publish-Subscribe or Pub-Sub pattern where components or classes subscribe to a publisher. In our example above, the VideoEncoder could be the publisher/event sender while the MailService would be the subscriber/event receiver. VideoEncoder does not need to know anything about the MailService in order for this to work.

Below is a very simple code example illustrating the use of Events:

```cs
public class VideoEncoder {
    public void Encode(Video video) {
        // Encoding logic...

        OnVideoEncoded(); // Notify the subscribers that encoding has occurred.
    }
}

public class MailService {
    // A method implemented by the subscriber, an "Event Handler"
    public void OnVideoEncoded(object source, EventArgs e) {
         
    }
}
```

> Note: The Subscriber implements the *Event Handler* in the example above. The signature of this method is decided by a delegate in the Publisher.

**Delegate definition for Pub-Sub**  
* Agreement/contract between Publisher and Subscriber.
* Determines the signature of the event handler method in the Subscriber.

**Steps to follow in order to setup Publish-Subscribe**  
1. Define a delegate (the contract between the Publisher and Subscriber)
2. Define an event based on the delegate
3. Raise or publish the event

Below is a code example of a basic setup (note that there are almost duplicates of some lines in order to show how to pass data about the event that happened):  

```cs
public class Video {
    public string Title { get; set; }
}

public class VideoEventArgs : EventArgs {
    public Video Video { get; set; }
}

public class VideoEncoder {
    // The first parameter is always an object in C#.
    // EventArgs is typically any additional data that we want to send with the event.
    // The naming convention of the function is typically the name of the event followed by "EventHandler".
    public delegate void VideoEncodedEventHandler(object source, EventArgs args); // Without arguments

    public delegate void VideoEncodedEventHandler(object source, VideoEventArgs args); // With arguments

    public event VideoEncodedEventHandler VideoEncoded;

    public void Encode(Video video) {
        Console.WriteLine("Encoding video...");
        Thread.Sleep(3000); // Simulate video encoding

        OnVideoEncoded(video);
    }

    // Event Publisher methods should be protected, virtual and return void.
    // The naming convention is the word "On" followed by the name of the event.
    protected virtual void OnVideoEncoded(Video video) {
        // If there are any subscribers check
        if (VideoEncoded != null) {
            // The current class, "this" is publishing the event.
            // We pass EventArgs.Empty to not pass any data along.
            VideoEncoded(this, EventArgs.Empty); // Without arguments

            VideoEncoded(this, new VideoEventArgs() { Video = video }); // With arguments
        }
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var video = new Video() { Title = "Video 1" };
        var videoEncoder = new VideoEncoder(); // Publisher
        var mailService = new MailService(); // Subscriber
        var messageService = new MessageService(); // Subscriber

        videoEncoder.VideoEncoded += mailService.OnVideoEncoded; // Setup event handler
        videoEncoder.VideoEncoded += messageService.OnVideoEncoded; // Setup another event handler

        videoEncoder.Encode(video);
    }
}

public class MailService {
    // Without arguments
    public void OnVideoEncoded(object source, EventArgs e) {
        Console.WriteLine("MailService: Sending an email...");
    }

    // With arguments
    public void OnVideoEncoded(object source, VideoEventArgs e) {
        Console.WriteLine("MailService: Sending an email..." + e.Video.Title);
    }
}

public class MessageService {
    // Without arguments
    public void OnVideoEncoded(object source, EventArgs e) {
        Console.WriteLine("MessageService: Sending a text message...");
    }

    // With arguments
    public void OnVideoEncoded(object source, VideoEventArgs e) {
        Console.WriteLine("MessageService: Sending a text message..." + e.Video.Title);
    }
}
```

There is an even simpler way to do this with predefined .NET delegate types. There are two different types:  
* EventHandler (without arguments)
* EventHandler<TEventArgs> (with arguments)

These types are basically always used instead of defining your own delegate when using events.

> Replace `public event VideoEncodedEventHandler VideoEncoded;` with `public event EventHandler<VideoEventArgs> VideoEncoded` and remove the delegate declaration in order to use the C# predefined EventHandler delegate.

## Extension Methods
The definition of extension methods:  
They allow us to add methods to an existing class without
* changing its source code
* creating a new class that inherits from it

Below is a code example:  

```cs
class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        string post = "This is supposed to be a very long post blah blah blah...";
        var shortenedPost = post.Shorten(5);
    }
}

namespace System {
    // A static class  is necessary to add extension methods to an existing class
    // The naming convention of the class you are extending followed by "Extensions" is a good practice
    public static class StringExtensions {
        // First parameter will always have the "this" keyword followed by the type you are extending
        public static string Shorten(this String str, int numberOfWords) {
            if (numberOfWords < 0)
                throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("numberOfWords should be greater or equal to 0.");
            if (numberOfWords == 0) return "";

            var words = str.Split(' ');

            if (words.Length <= numberOfWords) return str;

            return string.Join(" ", words.Take(numberOfWords)) + "...";
        }
    }
}
```

> In the example above we extend the String class with a Shorten Method. Note that the namespace of our StringExtensions class is System, thus whenever we import System in order to access String we also get our extension methods.

Only create extension methods when you have to. Usually you will use extension methods rather than create them yourself. An example of this is the IEnumerable interface. This interface has lots of extension methods that were added with the introduction of LINQ. See the next chapter for an in depth look at LINQ. 



## LINQ
LINQ is one of the most well known features of C#. LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query and gives you the capability to query objects.

You can query
* Objects in memory, e.g. collections (LINQ to Objects)
* Databases (LINQ to Entities)
* XML (LINQ to XML)
* ADO.NET Data Sets (LINQ to Data Sets)

Below is a code example that filters a list of books and compares the usual foreach approach to the LINQ approach:

```cs
class Book {
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public float Price { get; set; }
}

class BookRepository {
    public IEnumerable<Book> GetBooks() {
        return new List<Book> {
            new Book() { Title = "Book 1", Price = 5 },
            new Book() { Title = "Book 2", Price = 9.99f },
            new Book() { Title = "Book 3", Price = 12 },
            new Book() { Title = "Book 4", Price = 7 },
            new Book() { Title = "Book 5", Price = 9 }
        };
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var books = new BookRepository().GetBooks();

        // Without LINQ
        var cheapBooks = new List<Book>();
        foreach (var book in books) {
            if (book.Price < 10) cheapBooks.Add(book);
        }

        // With LINQ
        cheapBooks = books.Where(b => b.Price < 10);

        foreach (var book in cheapBooks) {
            Console.WriteLine(book.Title + " " + book.Price);
        }
    }
}
```

Below are a few examples or basic LINQ usage and a comparison between LINQ Extension Methods and LINQ Query Operators:  

```cs 
static void Main(string[] args) {

    // LINQ Extension Methods

    // Sorting
    books.OrderBy(b => b.Title);

    // Method chaining
    books
        .Where(b => b.Price < 10)
        .OrderBy(b => b.Title);

    // Select is used for projection or transformation (do something for each book or select some property)
    books
        .Where(b => b.Price < 10)
        .OrderBy(b => b.Title)
        .Select(b => b.Title);

    // LINQ Query Operators
    var cheaperBooks = from b in books
                       where b.Price < 10
                       orderby b.Title
                       select b.Title;
}
```

> Note: The LINQ query operator for selecting all book titles with price less than 10 is equal to the same query using LINQ extension methods. A LINQ query operator always start with "from" and end with "select".

Below are some great ways to make use of LINQ:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    // Get a single instance from the book list (crashes if no matching elements are found)
    books.Single(b => b.Title == "Book 1")

    // Get a single instance from the book list but return null if no elements are found
    books.SingleOrDefault(b => b.Title == "Book that does not exist")

    // Get the first instance with the given title
    books.First(b => b.Title == "Book 3");
    books.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Title == "Book 3");

    // Get the last instance with the given title
    books.Last(b => b.Title == "Book 3");
    books.LastOrDefault(b => b.Title == "Book 3");

    // Skip the first 2 objects and return the next 3
    books.Skip(2).Take(3);

    // Count the number of books
    books.Count();

    // Return the most/least expensive book
    books.Max(b => b.Price);
    books.Min(b => b.Price);

    // Sum all prices together
    books.Sum(b => b.Price);

    // Get the average of the prices
    books.Average(b => b.Price);
}
```

## Nullable Types
Nullable types exist in order to make it possible to have optional values that are allowed to be null. In Swift this would be called an Optional and declared in the following way: `let number: Int? = nil`. The questionmark specifies that it is an Optional.

**Value types**
* Cannot be null
* bool hasAccess = true; // or false

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    Nullable<DateTime> date = null; // DateTime is a value type and needs a Nullable wrapper in order to be null
    DateTime? date = null; // Shorthand version (very common syntax in most languages)

    // Get the value or the default
    date.GetValueOrDefault();

    // Does the Nullable have a value or not?
    date.HasValue;

    // The value of the object. Throws an exception if no value is present. For a Nullable you should use GetValueOrDefault()
    date.Value;

    // Assign nullable to non-nullabe
    DateTime? date = new DateTime(2014, 1, 1);
    DateTime date2 = date; // Compilation error
    DateTime date2 = date.GetValueOrDefault(); // Works

    // Null Coalescing Operator
    DateTime? nullDate = null;
    date2 = nullDate ?? DateTime.Today; // Get the value if not null, otherwise use today's time and date

    // Tertiary Operator
    date2 = (date != null) ? nullDate.GetValueOrDefault() : DateTime.Today; // longer version of null coalescion

    // Null Conditional Operator
    // Evaluate the first operand; if that's null, stop, with a result of null. Otherwise, evaluate the second operand (as a member access of the first operand).
    string str = null;
    var tmp = str?.ToString(); // Assign null to tmp since str is null, do not attempt to call ToString()
}
```

## Dynamics
Dynamics is one of the features in C# that confuse a lot of developers. In reality, it is quite simple.
There are two types of programming languages:  
* Statically-typed languages: C#, Java
* Dynamically-typed languages: Ruby, Javascript, Python

> In static languages, type resolution (resolution of types, properties, members, methods) happens at compile-time.

> In dynamic languages, type resolution (resolution of types, properties, members, methods) happens at run-time.

**Benefits**
* Static languages: early feedback (compile-time)
* Dynamic languages: easier and faster to code

### Reflection
Reflection provides objects (of type Type) that describe assemblies, modules, and types. You can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties. If you are using attributes in your code, reflection enables you to access them. For more information, see Attributes.

Reflection allows you to get access to methods/properties based on strings. It is not very beautiful but can be useful in some cases.

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    object obj = "Jacob";
    obj.GetHashCode();

    // Invoke the GetHashCode method using reflection
    var methodInfo = obj.GetType().GetMethod("GetHashCode");
    methodInfo.Invoke(null, null);
}
```

### Making use of Dynamics
Dynamics allow us to declare variables as dynamically typed. If we know that the object in the code example below has an Optimize method at run-time we can set it as a dynamic in order to get around the statically typed restrictions.

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    dynamic obj = "Jacob";
    obj.Optimize(); // No compile-time error
}
```

> CLR (Common Language Runtime) is the .NET virtual machine that gets your compiled code and converts it into machine code at runtime. In .NET Framework 4 they added the DLR (Dynamic Language Runtime) which sits on top of CLR and gives dynamic capabilities to .NET.

Below are a few basic code examples that shows the attributes of dynamics:
```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    dynamic name = "Jacob";
    name = 10; // Works

    dynamic a = 10;
    dynamic b = 5;
    var c = a + b; // var becomes dynamic

    int i = 5;
    dynamic d = i; // Implicit type conversion
    long l = d; // No need to cast since an int can be placed into a long
}
``` 

## Exception Handling
We need exception handling in order to deal with unexpected events or crashes of our applications. If we do not handle exceptions, the application will crash with an exception and we get a stack trace that specifies the sequence of method calls in reversed order.

We use try/catch blocks in order to deal with exceptions:  

```cs
class Calculator {
    public int Divide(int numerator, int denomerator) {
        return numerator/denomerator;
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var calculator = new Calculator();
        try {
            var result = calculator.Divide(5, 0); // 0 does not work as a denominator, System.DivideByZeroException
        } catch(Exception e) {
            // In the catch block we can either rethrow the error to the caller of the code or deal with it in order to continue execution
            Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred.");
        }
    }
}
```

The properties of an exception:  
* Message: The message connected to the specific exception
* Source: The assembly or dll that the exception originated from
* Stack Trace: The reverse sequence of method calls that lead to the exception
* Target Site: The location where the exception happened
* Inner Exception: An exception that could be inside the exception
* Data: Sometimes an exception can contain some more data about the exception

Remember to call the Dispose method in a finally block if you are dealing with unmanaged resources. The finally block is ALWAYS executed. This is to make sure that you are not keeping files open or network connections open etc. and eventually run out of resources. Look at the example below:  

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    StreamReader streamReader = null;
    try {
        streamReader = new StreamReader(@"C:\file.zip");
        var content = streamReader.ReadToEnd();
    } catch(Exception e) {
        Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred.");
    } finally { // Finally block is ALWAYS executed
        // If we have classes that use unmanaged resources such as database connections, network connections, file handlers etc.that are not handled by the garbage collector automatically we need to implement the IDisposible interface.
        if (streamReader != null)
            streamReader.Dispose(); // If something goes wrong when reading we make sure to close the stream
    }
}
```

If we want to clean up the code above we can use the "using" keyword which creates a finally block internally and call the Dispose method for us:

```cs
static void Main(string[] args) {
    try {
        using (var streamReader = new StreamReader(@"C:\file.zip")) {
            var content = streamReader.ReadToEnd();
        }
    } catch(Exception e) {
        Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred.");
    }
}
```

### Creating Custom Exceptions
Sometimes we want to create custom exceptions in order to not expose lots of different low level exceptions to the higher level of our application.

In the following example, if we get a YouTubeException maybe we want to return a default list of videos instead. Look at the example code below:

```cs
public class YouTubeException : Exception
{
    public YouTubeException(string message, Exception innerException)
        : base(message, innerException)
    {
    }
}

public class YouTubeApi
{
    public List<Video> GetVideos(string user)
    {
        try
        {
            // Access YouTube web service 
            // Read the data 
            // Create a list of Video objects
            throw new Exception("Oops some low level YouTube error.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log exception

            // Catch all low level exceptions, log them and wrap them all in a YoutubeException. 
            throw new YouTubeException("Could not fetch the videos from YouTube.", ex); // wrap the actual exception in our YouTubeException
        }

        return new List<Video>();
    }
}
```

> Note: in the real world when using something like Entity Framework for accessing databases you will see rather generic exceptions and then you can keep looking at the Inner Exceptions to see the actual reason to why the exception occurred.

## Asynchronous Programming with Async/Await
**Synchronous programming**
* Program is executed line by line, one at a time
* When a function is called, program execution has to wait until the function returns

**Asynchronous programming**
* When a function is called, program execution continues to the next line *WITHOUT* waiting for the function to complete

**Attributes of asynchronous programming**
* Improves responsiveness (think about Windows Media Player, when you press play the UI continues to be responsive. You can do things like resize the window, move it around, see an animation.)
* Used when accessing the Web, when working with files and databases, working with images etc.
* How to use it? Traditionally in C#: Multi-threading, callbacks. New in .NET 4.5: Async/Await

Below is a small code example for a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application code snippet to illustrate how to use async:

```cs
// We need to return a Task object which encapsulates the state of an asynchronous operation
// It is good convention to add the Async suffix to the name of the method 
public async Task DownloadHtmlAsync(string url) {
    var webClient = new WebClient();

    // await is a marker for the compiler which lets it know that this operation might take some time so we can move on with other things
    var html = await webClient.DownLoadStringTaskAsync(url); 

    using(var streamWriter = new StreamWriter(@"C:\result.html")) {
        await streamWriter.WriteAsync(html);
    }
}

public async Task<string> GetHtmlAsync(string url) {
    var webClient = new WebClient();

    return await webClient.DownloadStringTaskAsync(url);
}

private async void CallAsyncMethods() {
    DownloadHtmlAsync("http://msdn.microsoft.com");

    // Direct await
    var html = await GetHtmlAsync("http://msdn.microsoft.com");

    // Assign task and await later
    var getHtmlTask = GetHtmlAsync("http://msdn.microsoft.com");
    MessageBox.Show("Waiting for task to finish"); // Do some work that is not dependent on the completion of the task
    html = await getHtmlTask;
}
```

We use await in the example above to let the compiler know that we do not want execution to be blocked and that it can come back later when the await method call is done to continue execution. The await keyword can only be used in async methods.

> Note: We use the non-generic version Task when our method returns void and the generic method Task<T> when we need to return something from the method.

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is one one of the main aspect of OOPS Principles which include method overriding and method overloading. Virtual and Override keyword are used for method overriding and new keyword is used for method hiding.

* The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declared in the base class and allow it to be overridden in the derived class.
* The override keyword is used to extend or modify a virtual/abstract method, property, indexer, or event of base class into derived class.
* The new keyword is used to hide a method, property, indexer, or event of base class into derived class.

Consider the below class hierarchy with classes A, B, and C. A is the super/base class, B is derived from class A and C is derived from class B.

A (super/base class) --> B --> C

### Method hiding
For hiding the base class method from derived class simply declare the derived class method with a new keyword.

```cs
using System;
namespace Polymorphism
{
    class A
    {
        public void Test() { Console.WriteLine("A::Test()"); }
    }

    class B : A
    {
        public new void Test() { Console.WriteLine("B::Test()"); }
    }

    class C : B
    {
        public new void Test() { Console.WriteLine("C::Test()"); }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            A a = new A();
            B b = new B();
            C c = new C();

            a.Test(); // output --> "A::Test()"
            b.Test(); // output --> "B::Test()"
            c.Test(); // output --> "C::Test()"

            a = new B();
            a.Test(); // output --> "A::Test()"

            b = new C();
            b.Test(); // output --> "B::Test()"

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

### Method overriding
In C#, for overriding the base class method in a derived class, you have to declare a base class method as virtual and derived class method asoverride shown below:

```cs
using System;
namespace Polymorphism
{
    class A
    {
        public virtual void Test() { Console.WriteLine("A::Test()"); }
    }

    class B : A
    {
        public override void Test() { Console.WriteLine("B::Test()"); }
    }

    class C : B
    {
        public override void Test() { Console.WriteLine("C::Test()"); }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            A a = new A();
            B b = new B();
            C c = new C();
            a.Test(); // output --> "A::Test()"
            b.Test(); // output --> "B::Test()"
            c.Test(); // output --> "C::Test()"

            a = new B();
            a.Test(); // output --> "B::Test()"

            b = new C();
            b.Test(); // output --> "C::Test()"

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

### Method overloading
You can also mix the method hiding and method overriding by using virtual and new keyword since the method of a derived class can be virtual and new at the same time. This is required when you want to further override the derived class method into next level as I am overriding Class B, Test() method in Class C as shown below:

```cs
using System;
namespace Polymorphism
{
    class A
    {
        public void Test() { Console.WriteLine("A::Test()"); }
    }

    class B : A
    {
        public new virtual void Test() { Console.WriteLine("B::Test()"); }
    }

    class C : B
    {
        public override void Test() { Console.WriteLine("C::Test()"); }
    }

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            A a = new A();
            B b = new B();
            C c = new C();

            a.Test(); // output --> "A::Test()"
            b.Test(); // output --> "B::Test()"
            c.Test(); // output --> "C::Test()"

            a = new B();
            a.Test(); // output --> "A::Test()"

            b = new C();
            b.Test(); // output --> "C::Test()"

            Console.ReadKey();
        }
    }
}
```

## Access Modifiers

* **public**: The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.  
* **private**: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.  
* **protected**: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class, or in a class that is derived from that class.  
* **internal**: The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.  
* **protected internal**: The type or member can be accessed by any code in the assembly in which it's declared, or from within a derived class in another assembly.  
* **private protected**: The type or member can be accessed only within its declaring assembly, by code in the same class or in a type that is derived from that class.  

## yield return
The yield keyword signals to the compiler that the method in which it appears is an iterator block.  The compiler generates a class to implement the behavior that is expressed in the iterator block. In the iterator block, the yield keyword is used together with the return keyword to provide a value to the enumerator object. This is the value that is returned, for example, in each loop of a foreach statement. The yield keyword is also used with break to signal the end of iteration.

> yield creates a state machine "under the covers" that remembers where you were on each additional cycle of the function and picks up from there.

```cs
// BEFORE
public static IEnumerable func(int start, int number) {
    int[] _number = new int[number];
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        _number[i] = start + 2 * i
    }

    return _number;
}

// AFTER
public static IEnumerable func(int start, int number) {
    for (int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        yield return start + 2 * i
    }
}

```

## The ref keyword
The ref keyword in C# is used for passing or returning references of values to or from Methods. Basically, it means that any change made to a value that is passed by reference will reflect this change since you are modifying the value at the address and not just the value. It can be implemented in the following cases:

* To pass an argument to a method by its reference.
* To define a method signature to return a reference of the variable.
* To declare a struct as a ref struct
* As local reference

```cs
// Main Method 
static void Main(string[] args) 
{ 
  
    // Initialize a and b 
    int a = 10, b = 12; 

    // Display initial values 
    Console.WriteLine("Initial value of a is {0}", a); 
    Console.WriteLine("Initial value of b is {0}", b); 
    Console.WriteLine(); 

    // Call addValue method by value 
    addValue(a); 

    // Display modified value of a 
    Console.WriteLine("Value of a after addition"+ 
                            " operation is {0}", a); 

    // Call subtractValue method by ref 
    subtractValue(ref b); 

    // Display modified value of b 
    Console.WriteLine("Value of b after "+ 
        "subtration operation is {0}", b); 
} 

// Define addValue 
// Parameters passed by value 
public static void addValue(int a) 
{ 
    a += 10; 
} 

// Define subtractValue 
// Parameters passed by ref 
public static void subtractValue(ref int b) 
{ 
    b -= 5; 
} 
```

Output:  
```
Initial value of a is 10  
Initial value of b is 12  

Value of a after addition operation is 10  
Value of b after subtration operation is 7  
```

## The in keyword
The in keyword causes arguments to be passed by reference. It makes the formal parameter an alias for the argument, which must be a variable. In other words, any operation on the parameter is made on the argument. It is like the ref or out keywords, except that in arguments cannot be modified by the called method. Whereas ref arguments may be modified, out arguments must be modified by the called method, and those modifications are observable in the calling context.

Generally speaking, there is only one use case where in can be helpful: high performance apps dealing with lots of large readonly structs.

```cs
int readonlyArgument = 44;
InArgExample(readonlyArgument);
Console.WriteLine(readonlyArgument);     // value is still 44

void InArgExample(in int number)
{
    // Uncomment the following line to see error CS8331
    //number = 19;
}
```

## The out keyword
You can use the out keyword in two contexts:

* As a parameter modifier, which lets you pass an argument to a method by reference rather than by value.
* In generic type parameter declarations for interfaces and delegates, which specifies that a type parameter is covariant.

### Parameter modifier
The out keyword causes arguments to be passed by reference. It makes the formal parameter an alias for the argument, which must be a variable. In other words, any operation on the parameter is made on the argument. It is like the ref keyword, except that ref requires that the variable be initialized before it is passed. It is also like the in keyword, except that in does not allow the called method to modify the argument value. To use an out parameter, both the method definition and the calling method must explicitly use the out keyword. For example:

```cs
int initializeInMethod;
OutArgExample(out initializeInMethod);
Console.WriteLine(initializeInMethod); // value is now 44

void OutArgExample(out int number)
{
    number = 44;
}
```

## Generic type declarations
For generic type parameters, the out keyword specifies that the type parameter is covariant. You can use the out keyword in generic interfaces and delegates.

Covariance enables you to use a more derived type than that specified by the generic parameter. This allows for implicit conversion of classes that implement covariant interfaces and implicit conversion of delegate types. Covariance and contravariance are supported for reference types, but they are not supported for value types.

An interface that has a covariant type parameter enables its methods to return more derived types than those specified by the type parameter. For example, because in .NET Framework 4, in IEnumerable<T>, type T is covariant, you can assign an object of the IEnumerable(Of String) type to an object of the IEnumerable(Of Object) type without using any special conversion methods.

```cs
// Covariant interface.
interface ICovariant<out R> { }

// Extending covariant interface.
interface IExtCovariant<out R> : ICovariant<R> { }

// Implementing covariant interface.
class Sample<R> : ICovariant<R> { }

class Program
{
    static void Test()
    {
        ICovariant<Object> iobj = new Sample<Object>();
        ICovariant<String> istr = new Sample<String>();

        // You can assign istr to iobj because
        // the ICovariant interface is covariant.
        iobj = istr;
    }
}
```

## Value types vs Reference types
In C#, these two data types are categorized based on how they store their value in the memory.

### Value type
A data type is a value type if it holds a data value within its own memory space. It means the variables of these data types directly contain values.

The following data types are all of value type:

bool  
byte  
char  
decimal  
double  
enum  
float  
int  
long  
sbyte  
short  
struct  
uint  
ulong  
ushort  

> When you pass a value-type variable from one method to another, the system creates a separate copy of a variable in another method. If value got changed in the one method, it wouldn't affect the variable in another method.

### Reference type
Unlike value types, a reference type doesn't store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored. In other words, a reference type contains a pointer to another memory location that holds the data.

The followings are reference type data types:

String
Arrays (even if their elements are value types)
Class
Delegate

```cs
static void ChangeReferenceType(Student std2)
{
    std2.StudentName = "Steve";
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Student std1 = new Student();
    std1.StudentName = "Bill";
    
    ChangeReferenceType(std1);

    Console.WriteLine(std1.StudentName);
}
```

> Output: Steve
